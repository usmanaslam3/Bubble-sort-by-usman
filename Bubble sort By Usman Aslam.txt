Bubble sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. 

Working.

1.Start with the first element (index 0) of the array.
2.Compare it with the next element (index 1).
3.If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
4.Move to the next pair of elements (index 1 and index 2) and repeat steps 2 and 3.
5.Continue this process until you reach the end of the array.
6.After the first pass, the largest element will have "bubbled up" to the end of the array.
7.Repeat the process, but this time, ignore the last element because it's already in its correct position.
Continue this process for the remaining elements.

Example.

lets have an array of 5 numbers .  [3, 19, 11, 44, 33].

for (int i=0; i < n-1 : i++{
for (int j=0; j < n-1 ; j++ {

if(a[j+1] <a[j]) {

swap ( a, j+1 , j);

}
}
void swap(int a[], int i,int j ){
int temp = a [i];
a[i] = a[i];
a[j] = temp;
}
